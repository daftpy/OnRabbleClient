    \section1 Overview

    The discovery flow is the entry point for initializing a connection to a chat server.
    It begins when the user enters a server URL and ends with a parsed \l {DiscoveryPayload}
    containing endpoint metadata required for login and messaging.

    This process is handled by the \l {DiscoveryManager}, which delegates the actual HTTP
    request and JSON parsing to \l {DiscoveryCore}. The result is then emitted to QML or
    application logic via success or failure signals.

    This flow ensures that the application can dynamically adapt to different server
    configurations without requiring hardcoded URLs.

    \section1 Flow Summary

    \list
        \li The user enters or selects a discovery URL
        \li \l {DiscoveryManager} is called with \c discover(urlString)
        \li \l {DiscoveryCore} performs a GET request to the URL
        \li The server responds with a JSON object describing auth and chat endpoints
        \li The JSON is parsed into a \l {DiscoveryPayload}
        \li On success, \l {DiscoveryManager} emits \c discoverySuccess with the payload
        \li On failure, \l {DiscoveryManager} emits \c discoveryFailed with an error message
    \endlist
